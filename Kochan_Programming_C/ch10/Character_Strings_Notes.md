# Character Strings  - Notes

Strings do not exist in C, and the `char` data type can only hold a single character.

If you want to have variables with more than a single character, we need an array of characters, or Character Strings.

### Example

```c

/*
 *      if array size unspecified, compiler will automatically
 *      compute elements based on what you have set var to.
 */

char msg[] = { 'W', 'e', 'l', 'c', 'o', 'm', 'e' };

```

This is tedious, so this is also allowed:

```c

char msg[] = "Welcome";

```
